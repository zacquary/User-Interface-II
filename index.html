    <p> ZacQuary Lincoln <a href="./projects.html">My Projects</a> and I just started out on my coding journey and
        it is something I consider to be quite interesting. It's very fun to learn how
        things work and to get them working in which the way you desire them to work.
        I hope things continue to progress and I continue to grow along with the rest
        of my class.
